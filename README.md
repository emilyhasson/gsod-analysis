## How to gather data

Two `.py` files are required on your local computer to retrieve more data than provided in the sample `/data` folder. After installing all necessary libraries, make sure that your two `.py` files are in the same directory as the `archive/` folder generated by the Kaggle page, like such:

```
STAT480/Project/
├── archive/
│   ├── gsod_all_years/     (make sure it is opened and NOT a .zip file)
│   └── ...
├── ...
├── data_agg.py
└── gzip_pal.py
```

After setting up your directory like above, you're now able to run `data_agg.py` to gather the year(s)/station(s) you'd like. **Note**: if you want to select any years outside of 2000-2019, modify the `range(2000, 2020)` function on `line 60` of `data_agg.py` to `range(start_year, end_year + 1)` (station-by-station functionality not taken care of yet).

```
python3 data_agg.py
```

As this script runs, you'll see progress bars and reports detailing the script's performance in real-time. If the script stops, it could be due to one of a couple things:
- the sample of the current year does not have valid stations
- a library is not properly installed
- lucas is stupid and forgot to account for something (in which case please lmk)

After your script has ran for some time, assuming it has made it all the way through, your directory should now look like such:

```
STAT480/Project/
├── archive/
│   ├── gsod_all_years (make sure it is opened and not a .zip file)
│   └── ...
├── {start_year}_data/
│   ├── gsod_all_years (make sure it is opened and not a .zip file)
│   └── ...
├── {start_year + 1}_data/
│   ├── gsod_all_years (make sure it is opened and not a .zip file)
│   └── ...
├── ...
├── {end_year}_data/
│   ├── gsod_all_years (make sure it is opened and not a .zip file)
│   └── ...
├── data_agg.py
└── gzip_pal.py
```

## Next Steps

- Clear directory after done extracting sample because it will copy all `.gz` files to the new directory, hence doubling storage requirements.
- Expand sample size to pump that storage requirement up.
