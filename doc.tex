\section{Related Work}

Weather forecasting has proven to be a difficult task, involving the ingestion of massive amounts of climate streaming data by models fit for big data with the purpose of summarizing observed or forecasting unobserved weather data. Numerous industries and professionals rely on the accuracy of these forecasts, stressing the importance of first accurately measuring various weather attributes across time. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss published work that relates to your project.
  \item Emphasize how your approach will be similar or different from others.
\end{itemize}

We will be looking for a \textbf{\underline{minimum of 6}} scholarly works cited.

Three citations must originate from either a scholarly journal or are pre-prints on arXiv. Consider searching for articles using Google Scholar: \texttt{https://scholar.google.com/}. From there, click the “cite” button to automatically generate the appropriate citation from MLA, APA, or BibTex. That said, there is a preference for using BibLaTeX or natbib to avoid any bibliography formatting errors or mixing styles.

\section{Data}
  
For our project, we will be working with structured weather data provided by various weather-related government agencies\footnote{Archived dataset can be found on Kaggle: \textit{NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day} (see References)}, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Climate and Environmental Institution (NCEI), gathered by each of the internationally distributed sensors from the beginning of 1901 to the end of 2019. Each of these sensors report basic logging information (e.g., datetime and station identification) - which can be merged with provided text files in the same archive that provide geographical information (latitude, longitude, named location) of each station - as well as climate data on a daily basis (e.g., mean temperature (F), dew point (F), natural disaster indicators, etc.). Although the entire archive spans 120 years, we will strictly be focusing on data generated beyond 1975, the year the NOAA decided to increase the number of sensors they deploy. Altogether, this sample of the original archives contains 23GB of data comprised of NN million observations with 23 attributes each.

Prior to conducting our analyses below, we did not perform any preprocessing to our data. However, this does not mean that the data was prepared ready for analysis. Rather, only after iterating over each year's series of `.gz` files were we able to prepare our dataset for analysis, including mapping a uniform null value to various missing value codes, expanding cluttered columns into multiple columns, and condensing each station's annual report to a single annual report. (Table 1 in the Appendix shows the first five and last five observations of the resulting dataset.) Given this, we will conduct k-fold cross validation on samples of our dataset below in our logistic regression models to allow hyperparameter selection to determine our best model.

\section{Preliminary Technical Details and Results}

\textbf{For points in this section, you must have \underline{at least one model fit} and described within the progress report.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe in detail the proposed model.
  \item Explain how it works in general (or specifically with your data).
  \item Show preliminary results in:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Summary tables:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Classification should highlight precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
      \item Regression should state the RMSE, MSE, or MAE.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Graphs

    \textbf{The temperature at this weather station appears to peak in July at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit and drop to less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit in February. This suggests that this weather station is most likely located in the northern hemisphere.} \\

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Training and validation graphs based on the cost/loss function and evaluation metric (accuracy, F1, recall, RMSE, ...)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Provide a timeline of the project to date and what the future work will entail.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Summarize completed and future work by using a Gantt chart to break down the tasks and due dates.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Break down each task by specifying \textbf{who} is \textbf{doing what} and \textbf{when} it will be done.
      \item Avoid saying ``Everyone in the group'' is working on a single task.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Code
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Please provide code in a ZIP file or link to a GitHub repository. \textbf{Do \underline{not} submit your data set!}
    \item \textbf{If you have a private GitHub repository, please add @coatless.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}

At the end of the progress report, please include a brief 1 - 2 sentence write-up of what each group member contributed to this stage of the project. Award each member with a percentage between 0 - 100 such that the sum of all percentages across group members will be equal to 100. \textbf{This section does not count toward the page limit.}

\section{Grading}

The project will be graded according to a big big big rubric. There will be no possibility for resubmission. To avoid grading surprises, please speak with a member of course staff about your draft during Office Hours prior to turning it in.
